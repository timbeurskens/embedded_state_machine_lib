peripherals can emit events (pin rising, pin falling, etc)
state machine can map peripheral events to state machine events (n to 1 mapping?)
state machine has an internal transition table (independent from external events, event mapping creates dependence)

state structure:
state initial {

on <event 1> {
// do stuff
}

on <event 2> {
// do stuff
}

on <door open> {
 goto<state_2>();
}
}
